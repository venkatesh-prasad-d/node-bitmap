# Bitmap 

## Target

There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or
black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The
distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.

Aim of this program:

    - reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input;
    - for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white;
    - writes the results to the standard output.
